# Vid Luther's Dot Files

This is a collection of scripts and settings I use on my laptop/desktop environments. 

You can use these scripts for yourself but YMMV, if anything, use this is a starting point for your
own custom environment. Just as I have. 

### Inspiration

These settings, files have been curated over the years, and have been inspired by others like.

 - [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
 - https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles

### bin

Some shell/ruby/python scripts that I use very often.

### fonts

Fonts that I use to make my life better in iTerm, these fonts are necessary
for the battery charge/github indicators to show properly in the zsh prompt.

### iterm

My iterm settings, and some themes I like. Basically, it's just the Pastel (Dark
Background colors preset, Incosolata for Powerline font)

### vidluther.zsh-theme

My custom theme for oh-my-zsh, credits/inspiration can be found within the file.

### githooks

Hooks I use/need often with git.
