# Vid Luther's Dot Files

This is a collection of scripts and settings I use on my laptop/desktop environments. 

You can use these scripts for yourself but YMMV, if anything, use this is a starting point for your
own custom environment. Just as I have. 

### Inspiration

These settings, files have been curated over the years, and have been inspired by others like.

 - [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
 - https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles

## Installation 

In order for things to work, you must have your shell be Zsh, and you must have the Oh My Zsh package.

On a new machine clone this repository and then run the setup.sh , cross your fingers. 


### aliases.sh
Aliases that I use often, make sure I have brew, rubies, etc installed first, otherwise some/most won't work. 


### bin

Some shell/ruby/python/go scripts that I use very often.

### gitconfig 
My ~/.gitconfig 

### githooks

Hooks I use/need often with git. 

##### Powerline Fonts 
Clone and install the fonts from here https://github.com/powerline/fonts

### vidluther.zsh-theme

My custom theme for oh-my-zsh, credits/inspiration can be found within the file.

## goacess.conf 
My config file for goaccess also references maxmind/geo stuff.
