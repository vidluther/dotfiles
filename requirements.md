# Requirements

This lists all the things that are needed on a laptop to make most of these things work. 

## Software
1. Dropbox [[ Dropbox ]]
1. Xcode/OS X Command Line Tools (open up Terminal and type 'git' it'll start the process of downloading the right stuff for you)

1.1 I use Ruby 2.1.2 , and the Gemset plugin, also be sure to enable the rbenv plugin in oh-my-zsh
