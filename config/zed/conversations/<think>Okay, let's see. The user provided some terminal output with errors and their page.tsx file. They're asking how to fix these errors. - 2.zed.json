Let me start by looking at the terminal output and the code provided.\n\nFirst, the terminal shows a ReferenceError: Button is not defined at src/app/page.tsx:24:15. That means the Button component isn't being imported correctly. Looking at the import statement, I see it's importing from \"@radix-ui/themes\". Wait, Radix UI's themes package probably doesn't include components like Button. I think the components are in a different package, maybe \"@radix-ui/react-button\".\n\nNext, there are errors about ShieldIcon and UsersIcon not being exported from '@radix-ui/react-icons'. That suggests that either the icons aren't exported from that module or they're named differently. Maybe I need to check if those specific icons are available in the react-icons package or if their names have changed.\n\nThen, there's a React.jsx error saying that the component type is invalid because it's undefined. This likely ties back to the import issues—since Button isn't imported correctly, it's undefined when used.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Fix the Button import by changing the source from \"@radix-ui/themes\" to \"@radix-ui/react-button\".\n2. Check if ShieldIcon and UsersIcon are available in '@radix-ui/react-icons'. If not, maybe they need to be imported from a different package or their names might be different.\n3. Ensure all other components like Flex, Card, etc., are correctly imported from the right packages.\n\nI'll start by correcting the Button import. Then, I'll verify each icon's availability and adjust the imports accordingly. This should resolve the undefined component errors and the ReferenceError.\n</think>\n\nThe errors in your code are due to incorrect imports and missing exports. Here's how to fix them:\n\n1. **Incorrect Button Import**:\n   - The `Button` component isn't exported from `\"@radix-ui/themes\"`. Instead, it's part of the Radix UI primitives.\n\n2. **Missing Icon Exports**:\n   - `ShieldIcon`, `UsersIcon`, and other icons aren't directly exported from `'@radix-ui/react-icons'`. You need to import them specifically.\n\nHere are the corrected imports:\n\n```tsx\nimport Link from \"next/link\";\n// Import components from Radix UI primitives\nimport {\n  Container,\n  Heading,\n  Text,\n} from \"@radix-ui/layout\";\nimport { Button } from \"@radix-ui/react-button\";\nimport { Flex } from \"@radix-ui/react-flex\";\nimport { Card, Grid, Box } from \"@radix-ui/react-card\";\n\n// Import icons specifically from '@radix-ui/react-icons'\nimport * as Icons from \"@radix-ui/react-icons\";\nconst {\n  ShieldIcon,\n  UsersIcon,\n  SwitchIcon,\n  BellIcon,\n} = Icons;\n```\n\nThen, update your feature array to use the icons correctly:\n\n```tsx\nconst features = [\n  {\n    icon: ShieldIcon,\n    title: \"Privacy Protection\",\n    description:\n      \"Keep your real phone number private when signing up for services and rewards programs.\",\n  },\n  // ... rest of the features\n];\n```\n\nAlso, ensure you've installed all necessary Radix UI packages:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @radix-ui/react-button @radix-ui/react-icons @radix-ui/layout @radix-ui/react-flex @radix-ui/react-card\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Button Import**: Changed to `@radix-ui/react-button`.\n- **Icons**: Imported all icons from `@radix-ui/react-icons` and then destructured the specific ones needed.\n- **Layout Components**: Separated layout components into their respective packages for clarity.\n\nThese changes should resolve the undefined component errors you're encountering.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":119}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":28},"start":6805,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":120}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":29},"start":10305,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":121}}}],"summary":"<think>Okay, let's see.
