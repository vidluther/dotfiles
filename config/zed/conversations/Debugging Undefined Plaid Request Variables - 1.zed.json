The properties are not present in the `req.body` object\n2. The `req.body` object itself might be empty or undefined\n\nPossible reasons:\n\n1. **Missing request body**: Your API endpoint might not be receiving any data in the request body.\n\n2. **Body parsing issue**: The middleware that parses request bodies (like `express.json()`) might not be set up correctly.\n\n3. **Property naming mismatch**: The client might be sending these properties with different names.\n\n4. **Request method**: If you're making a GET request, remember that GET requests typically don't have a request body.\n\nTo troubleshoot:\n\n1. Check what `console.log(req.body)` shows - is it an empty object `{}`?\n\n2. Verify your frontend is correctly sending these values in the request body.\n\n3. Make sure you have body parsing middleware set up in your Express app:\n   ```js\n   app.use(express.json());\n   app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\n   ```\n\n4. Check if the client is sending the data in the correct format (JSON vs form-data vs x-www-form-urlencoded).\n\n5. Use a tool like Postman to test the API directly with the correct request body.\nI'm seeing {\n  params: {\n    redirect_uri: 'http://localhost:3000/bank/accounts',\n    access_token: 'access-sandbox-f7692e6c-1948-4d59-bcdb-787cfa548c33'\n  }\n} in the console.log(req.body)\n\nI see the issue now! The data is nested inside a `params` object within `req.body`, rather than being at the top level of the request body.\n\nYou're trying to destructure at the wrong level. Instead of:\n\n```js\nconst { redirect_uri, access_token } = req.body\n```\n\nYou should be accessing the properties through the `params` object:\n\n```js\nconst { redirect_uri, access_token } = req.body.params\n```\n\nThis is why `access_token` and `redirect_uri` are coming back as undefined - they don't exist directly on `req.body`, but they do exist on `req.body.params`.\n\nThis kind of nesting often happens when:\n- Using certain frontend libraries that structure API requests this way\n- When using axios with a `params` configuration option\n- When the frontend is using a specific request formatting pattern\n\nUpdate your code to access the nested properties and that should fix the issue.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":173}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":27},"start":390,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":174}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":28},"start":1711,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":175}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":110},"start":1901,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":176}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":111},"start":2774,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":177}}}],"summary":"Debugging Undefined Plaid Request Variables","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":241},"icon":"TextSnippet","label":"edgeboost-api/src/controllers/v2/plaid.controller.js, Lines 60 to 64","metadata":null}]}
