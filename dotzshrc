## NOTE TO SELF. DO NOT MESS WITH THE ORDER UNLESS 
## POSITIVELY COHERRENT. 


# The order of setting the paths here ensures 
# whether custom installs of command line utils
# will run or stuff that comes pre-packaged by Apple.
 

# Add the Liip PHP stuff to the path if we have it.
# this ensures we're not using the more than likely out of date
# version of PHP and getting our php.ini overriden every update.
  
export PATH="/usr/local/php5/bin/:$PATH" #:/opt/chefdk/bin:$PATH"

# this ensures that commands like knife, kitchen, chef,
# berks, and so on are called from ChefDK, not rbenv.
# this confusion of paths has cost me hours of time away from
# Indi.  

# Remember, commands like knife, kitchen, chef, 
# will now run from /opt/chefdk/bin/chef

export PATH="/opt/chefdk/bin:$PATH"

# Now give rbenv the the rest of the common ruby commands
# This ensures commands like ruby, gem, bundle run from rbenv
# so now we can have our ruby version for the rails app be 2.1.5, 
# or whatever, and the Chef stuff updates as they need to.
